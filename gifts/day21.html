          <p>Remember this? Bro those philosophical lecture or conversations you could say were definitely memorable. I mean in one way you were right. We did have a blast. 8th grade was a roller coaster for sure but we did make so many amazing memories along the way. Though things didn't go exactly as plan it's fine because everything worked out in the end. Let's make this another pin: We're going to have a blast until the end of highschool, make more amazing memories, get into good colleges (in sha allah) and try to bring back that old middle school dynamic (i'm being serious about this one).</p>
