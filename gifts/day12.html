    <h3>Day 12: How Well Do You Know Me?</h3>
    <p>A little quiz to see if you remember things about me. Remember that time we did the buddy meter quizzes and you somehow got 10/10. I still think you cheated. So let's see if you actually pay attention to my yapping. Also screenshot the final score at the end, I wanna know if its 10/10 again.</p>
