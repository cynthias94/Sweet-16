            <p>Dear <span class="highlight-name">Ryan</span>,</p>
            <p>Well firstly, Happy birthday! Man, would've been nice if the surprise was in person, you know since your finally in New York during your birthday season for once. Actually, forget that, this turned out even cooler this way. You see, take this as a learning experience. Take notes on how to write a good, meaningful letter. Alright, jokes aside, who would've known that first moment we talked, way back in 6th grade, would lead to so many more funny, serious, annoying, and pure crazy memories? You probably don't even remember but still crazy to think back, that such a seemingly insignificant couple of minutes would be a key memory. I guess from there the real roller coaster began. 7th grade. 503. The most iconic class, let's be honest here. In that very classroom the stupidity was clearly at peak. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. From your stupid hand sanitizer, to hiding Mannat's water bottle, to  the shoes being thrown, our whole table getting interrogated for Jorge's covid test, the silly hand dance, losing my pencil (which you threw on that closet and even Adwaito couldn't get down), you choking on a plastic egg, the Irish dance lessons, and so much more, these memories are irreplacable. Alright now 8th grade. Ugh 8th grade. It was pretty decent, definitely better then whatever BSGE is, but bro that was a rough year. ELA state test, Math state test, Living Environment regents, Algebra 1 regents, Spanish proficiency, oh and of course the SHSAT. That year was very much something. I mean there were some good memories here and there. Volleyball, those basketball games, oh keeping your stuff safe while you played in those basketball games, that day when we were supposed to take grade photos and ended up playing that huge group QuackDillioso game. However, knowing us both, we were stressed. And I mean stressed with a capital S, even if we didn't let on exactly how bad it was. For you especially, that was a tough year. Breaking bones, the SHSAT, the anxiety, the pressure, being unable to play footy. You know that's what I find impressive about you. Even through all that, you still managed to push through and even give motivational speeches along the way. Miss those by the way. Though impressive, this is also something I hate about you. Abdullai, you really need to open up sometimes, more actually. Looking back at you then, never would've guessed that you would end up at therapy. Not that it's a bad thing. But still, yeah I remember those days where your confident was at an all time low, and those daily check-ins, but bro you need to learn to not deal with everything on your own. You know there's a ton of people that definitely noticed, so you have to stop being so strong on your own all the time. Nonethess, not happy about admitting it, but you are a good older brother/best friend, whatever it is. It's admirable how you're always ready to support or give suggestions, even when you yourself need the support too. You're crazy, Abdullai. You know, those days during that terrible high school application season and aftermath, really couldn't have made it without you and your insanely long lectures. Even now, though not as long, you're little lectures really go a long way. That whole 9th grade thing, during global, and basically every other little thing that got under your blood afterward, I'll apologize again for those. By now, you know pretty well how hot headed I can get and how much I overthink. It really leads to the most stupid decisions and way of thinking sometimes. Applaud to you for keeping cool and dealing with that, because honestly the oldest daughter syndrome goes crazy at times and I wouldn't even know how to deal with me. Honestly Abdullai, I think you offically have made it past the age of 6. Good job, you're mentally older then me now too. 16 is supposed to be a crazy milestone year, and even if you don't think so, I think you're still gonna make some big milestones. In sha allah. Stay locked in with footy, school, college prep basically, and yeah. Oh, and by the way, I still think you can make it big with soccer. Still crazy remembering when you said your family and other friends weren't as serious with that statement. Really do hope 16 treats you well. Eww bro this got sappy way too fast. Oh wait, real quick, if you think something is weird, it probably isn't with me, alright? You overthink a good bit too. Anyways, that's how you write a good letter. You better have taken good notes. </p>
            <p>from your amazing sister,</p>
