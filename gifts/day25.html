    <h2>Day 25: A Compliment Mixtape</h2>
    <p>You know it's been a while since we did compliments. Let's bring that back here real quick.</p>
</div>
<ul class="compliment-list">
    <li>You're the best listener</li>
    <li>You're so supportive, kind of scary sometimes</li>
    <li>You give pretty good advice</li>
    <li>You've definitely got the talent and strive to be a pro soccer player</li>
    <li>You're the older best brother</li>
    <li>Your humor is a little unhinged sometimes, but it's exactly what I need. Seriously, our inside jokes are my favorite thing.</li>
    <li>You might pretend you don't like gifts and birthdays, but I know deep down you're a good person who deserves the best.</li>
    <li>You're one of the only people I can trust and basically say anything to, and that means more to me than you know.</li>
</ul>
