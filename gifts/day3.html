    <p>Striker is trying to remember a story from our past. Can you fill in the blanks to help?</p>

            Once during 8th grade <input type="text" id="blank1" data-answer="regents" placeholder="[word]"> week, we were both so <input type="text" id="blank2" data-answer="tired" placeholder="[word]"> from studying.
            It was around <input type="text" id="blank3" data-answer="1 in the morning" placeholder="[phrase]"> and while I was basically losing it, and you kept reading your <input type="text" id="blank4" data-answer="living environment" placeholder="[phrase]"> notes and telling us both to push through a little longer. Funny thinking about this now, but I do have to admit those regents calls were a good time, though we were so locked in, well during most of it.
